### Hi, I'm Amin Kafri

Programming has been my friends since 2019. I started to take it seriously in 2021. I like doing some networking (CS wise), love data structures, love building all sort of things whether it is complex or not. Currently, I like to write Go program and I'm in love with how minimal and simple the language is. 

Love to do deep technical stuff.
