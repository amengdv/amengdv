### Hi, I'm Amin Kafri  

Programming and I go way back—2019, to be exact. We got serious in 2021, and it’s been a wild ride ever since! I dabble in all sorts of things, from networking (the computer kind, not the “let’s swap business cards” kind) to geeking out over data structures.  

Lately, I’ve been writing Go programs because, honestly, who wouldn’t love a language that’s minimal, simple, and just… *chef’s kiss*. I also have a thing for diving into deep technical stuff—it’s like my version of extreme sports.  

Check out my projects, and let’s build something awesome together (or debug endlessly—both are fun)!
